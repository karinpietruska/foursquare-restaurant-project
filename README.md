# foursquare_restaurant_project
Foursquare project conducted in December 2019 within the IBM Data Science Specialization to predict an optimal location for opening a restaurant with vegetarian and vegan cuisine in 
Frankfurt am Main, Germany. 
Programming Language: Python 

I used the Beautiful Soup Library to scrape information on the names and latitude and longitude coordinates of neighbourhoods in Frankfurt.
The Foursquare API was used to obtain information on restaurants in Frankfurt.
